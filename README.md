Description of the code.
1. run.py:Main program
2. train.py:train the proposed model.
3. test.py:test the proposed model.
4. extract_features_new.py:
5. model_4.py:The structure of the proposed model
6. transformer_1.py:The architecture of the Transformer

The experimental environment is a server with Intel i9-9900k, 64GB DDR4 memory and a Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU.
We use pytorch to implement the proposed model.
